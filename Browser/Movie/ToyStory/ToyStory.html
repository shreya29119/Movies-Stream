            <p>
                little boy named Andy loves to be in his room, playing with his toys,
                 especially his doll named "Woody". But, what do the toys do when Andy is
                 not with them, they come to life. Woody believes that his life (as a toy) is good.
                 However, he must worry about Andy's family moving, and what Woody does not know is
                 about Andy's birthday party. Woody does not realize that Andy's mother gave him an
                 action figure known as Buzz Lightyear, who does not believe that he is a toy, and quickly
                 becomes Andy's new favorite toy. Woody, who is now consumed with jealousy, tries to get rid
                 of Buzz....
